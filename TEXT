I reviewed todayâ€™s logs and observed that the settlement task failed due to the ACE page remaining unresponsive beyond the designated wait period. I believe an automated notification regarding this issue may have been sent to you. Could you kindly confirm whether you received such an email?

Regarding the journal task: The process has been completed for today and should have triggered an email notification. Please let me know if the email was received in your inbox or the distribution list (DL).

Finally, concerning the sensitivity configuration, I had previously configured the sensitivity settings during our UAT phase. Kendall, could you please confirm whether you encountered a similar issue when selecting sensitivity for the Excel file?
