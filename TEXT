Got it! Here's a more casual version suitable for a Teams chat:

Hi, my base location is Hyderabad campus, but I'm currently in Pune and want to log in from the Pune campus. I was informed that I can access it only 5 days a month. Could you help me get access for more than 5 days, or let me know the process to request it?
