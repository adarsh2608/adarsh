Subject: Request for Access to Kharadi EON Campus

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I kindly request your approval to grant me access to the Kharadi EON campus for a week. The purpose of my visit is to meet the local IT team to submit my headphones, as well as to connect with my colleagues during this time.

Your assistance in facilitating this access would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
