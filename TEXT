I found an issue with the Alteryx Email tool. In my Windows 10 workspace, I was able to send emails using SMTP in the Email tool by logging in with my secondary GPN and password through the Alteryx Gallery.

However, my RPA workspace has been upgraded to Windows 11, and from there, I am unable to send emails because the Email tool appears completely different from the one in the Windows 10 Alteryx Designer. This is despite both having the same version number. The difference is clearly shown in the image I uploaded.

Please advise on how to send emails in this scenario.
