Hi Kendall,

I tested the bot using the text file from May 12th that was attached in the email. When I ran the bot, it successfully extracted all the accounts mentioned in the file into an Excel sheet. At this point, I haven't encountered any issues, and I couldnâ€™t find any errors in the logs for the day the issue occurred.

As a precaution, I can implement additional validation to ensure the data is correctly extracted from the text file to the Excel sheet.

Please let me know
