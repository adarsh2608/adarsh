In addition to the email below, I would like to clarify that I reviewed the botâ€™s condition logic. The bot is configured to process only accounts with an account status of "A". Although the account is present in the IA text file retrieved from the source email, it is marked with a status of "X", due to which it was excluded by the bot.
