1) Strengths and Achievements
This year, I successfully completed and delivered three projects to production and have two more ready for deployment, pending SDD and code review.
Projects in Production:
ROB-102197: CUSIP Lookup
ROB-103027: ACAT End-to-End – a highly challenging bot that underwent multiple requirement changes and redevelopment cycles.
ROB-104122
Projects Ready for Production:
ROB-105721: IRD1 Exceptions
ROB-105589: Fixed Rate Contract
In addition, I rebuilt the entire CMRC workflow, migrating it from an Access database to an Alteryx workflow. This required significant re-engineering as the original database was outdated and required extensive client-driven updates.
I also participated in a UBS hackathon, collaborating with a cross-functional team to design and present a new automation idea to the wider community.
As part of the Big Rock initiative, I was responsible for resolving the Alteryx email setup challenge faced by our team. I identified a working solution and also developed an alternative approach using Python scripts, enabling reliable email automation from the Alteryx Designer.
Throughout the year, I actively collaborated with colleagues to troubleshoot ongoing issues with the ACE portal, sharing workarounds to enhance AA360 functionality. Additionally, I helped foster team engagement by organizing fun sessions that encouraged collaboration and connection beyond day-to-day work.
Impact:
Improved process efficiency through multiple automation solutions.
Strengthened team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Enhanced automation capability through technical problem-solving and innovation.
2) Development Areas
While I have made good progress in automation delivery and solution design, I recognize a few areas for further growth:
Documentation & Standardization: Improve efficiency in preparing SDDs and technical documentation to streamline the deployment process.
Stakeholder Communication: Strengthen early engagement with business users to minimize requirement rework and ensure better alignment.
Advanced Analytics & Scripting: Enhance my proficiency in Python and Alteryx advanced functions to expand automation capabilities and support more complex use cases.
Going forward, I aim to focus on these areas to deliver faster, more scalable, and better-documented automation solutions.
3) UBS Behaviours
Strengths Demonstrated:
Collaboration: Worked closely with teammates to resolve ACE portal challenges and shared best practices across projects.
Innovation: Proactively found new solutions for Alteryx email automation and contributed to hackathon idea development.
Accountability: Took ownership of complex bots, especially the ACAT End-to-End project, ensuring delivery despite multiple requirement iterations.
Client Focus: Rebuilt outdated workflows (e.g., CMRC) to align with evolving client needs and improve operational accuracy.
Opportunities to Demonstrate Further:
Continue fostering collaboration by mentoring new team members and sharing technical learnings.
Increase proactive communication with stakeholders to anticipate changes earlier in the project cycle.
Explore more cross-platform automation opportunities integrating Alteryx, Python, and AA360 for end-to-end business solutions.
