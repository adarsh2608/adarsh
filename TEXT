Subject: Root Cause Analysis and Resolution for Missing ACAT Account Entry – HJ18479

Hello Neil,

Root Cause:
The issue occurred when account HJ18479 was processed by the bot. As per the defined workflow, the bot correctly identified the account and accessed the RISK Reflection terminal to retrieve the associated Guaranteed accounts. The bot is configured to extract only those Guaranteed accounts that begin with specific prefixes—5V, 5F, 6M, or G9.

However, in this instance, the terminal returned a Guaranteed account that was identical to the ACAT account (HJ18479) and was prefixed with HJ, which is not part of the expected prefix list. Since the prefix did not match the predefined criteria, the bot did not recognize it as a valid Guaranteed account and consequently skipped the entry. As a result, HJ18479 was not added to the main ACAT Excel file, while other accounts were processed and included as expected.

Solution:
To ensure this issue does not recur, the bot’s logic has been enhanced to include all Guaranteed accounts irrespective of their prefixes. Any account with an unrecognized prefix will now be included in the Excel output and flagged with a status of “Manual Review”, indicating that it requires further verification. This change ensures all potential Guaranteed accounts are captured and appropriately flagged for review, thereby preventing similar omissions in the future.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
