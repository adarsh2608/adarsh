üåü Introduction / Opening Statement

In today‚Äôs fast-paced and hybrid work environment, staying connected, involved, and aware of opportunities within the organization can be challenging‚Äîespecially for new joiners or those looking to expand their skills and interests beyond their daily roles. Communities, both technical and non-technical, play a vital role in fostering collaboration, learning, and personal growth.

üîç Problem Statement

At UBS, while there are many amazing tech and non-tech communities, knowledge sharing platforms, and events, there is no centralized hub that unifies all this information. Employees often struggle with:

Discovering relevant communities or events

Keeping track of ongoing or upcoming sessions

Accessing past session recordings or learning materials

Finding mentorship or training opportunities based on skills and interests

Engaging effectively with others who share similar professional or personal interests


This fragmentation results in missed opportunities for participation, personal development, and cross-team collaboration.

Join relevant communities (e.g., Python, Leadership, Sports, etc.)
