Build an automated insight-driven community engagement engine that:

1. Analyzes community interaction patterns (via data from forums, chat groups, contribution platforms).


2. Identifies dormant users, trending topics, and contribution gaps.


3. Sends personalized nudges and suggestions using automation bots (email/chat).


4. Rewards contributors using a gamified scorecard.


5. Uses Alteryx for data workflows, Automation Anywhere for outreach, and Python for NLP or analytics logic.
