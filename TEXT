. Strengths and AchievementsThis year, I contributed significantly across multiple automation projects. I successfully delivered three bots to production (ROB-102197: CUISP Lookup, ROB-103027: ACAT End-to-End, and ROB-104122), while two more (ROB-105721: IRD1 Exceptions and ROB-105589: Fixed Rate Contract) are fully developed and ready for production after SDD and code review. The ACAT End-to-End bot was especially challenging due to frequent requirement changes and redevelopment, but I managed to adapt quickly and deliver efficiently.I also rebuilt the CMRC workflow from an outdated Access database into a modern Alteryx workflow, improving scalability and reliability. Additionally, I resolved a major Alteryx email setup issue under the Big Rock initiative and developed an alternative email solution using Python scripts within the Alteryx Designer, which was later adopted as a working method.Apart from project work, I participated in the team Hackathon, contributing an innovative idea to the UBS community. I actively collaborated with colleagues on the ACE portal, found workarounds using AA360, and supported team troubleshooting. To strengthen team bonding, I organized fun sessions to boost engagement beyond work.Impact: My work helped improve automation stability, save manual effort, enhance team collaboration, and support innovation through active problem-solving and idea generation.2. Development AreasI plan to enhance my technical expertise in advanced Python scripting and automation governance to deliver more reusable and optimized solutions. Additionally, I will focus on improving flow documentation and learning more about solution design to contribute earlier during the architecture phase.I also see scope for strengthening my domain understanding to anticipate changing client requirements and minimize rework during development. Increasing collaboration across different teams will allow me to expand my impact and share knowledge more effectively.3. UBS BehavioursThis year, I consistently demonstrated UBS behaviours such as collaboration, accountability, and innovation. I showed accountability by delivering high-quality automation solutions despite changing requirements and completing multiple bots on time. I collaborated closely with teammates to overcome ACE portal challenges and drove continuous improvement through knowledge sharing and problem-solving.Moving forward, I aim to continue fostering teamwork by mentoring newer members, participating in cross-team initiatives, and conducting knowledge-sharing sessions. I will also focus on seeking feedback and applying it to further align my work with UBS’s values and client-focused culture.
