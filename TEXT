Yes, when I executed the bot, it overwrote the account. As previously mentioned, the bot was designed to expect accounts prefixed with either '5V' or '5F'. Since the corresponding entries did not appear, the bot skipped this particular account and proceeded to the next. I will update the code to handle such scenarios by capturing the relevant information from the terminal. In cases where no matching accounts are found under Guaranteed accounts, the bot will retain the ACAT account in the Excel sheet instead of omitting it
