Hello Kendall,

I have reviewed the recording, and upon initial inspection, it appears there may be an issue—possibly with the account or with the terminal—when extracting data from the Risk terminal. The data seems to be getting overwritten during the update process in Excel.

I will investigate this further and provide you with an update
