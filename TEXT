I reviewed the logs, and based on the error, it appears that the issue occurred when a special character or an unknown string was encountered, causing the conversion from string to number format to fail. Unfortunately, I don’t have detailed information about the amount involved.

To address this, I’ve updated the logs to capture the string, making it easier to identify any problematic characters if the issue arises again.
