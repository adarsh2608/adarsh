Here’s a polished and balanced version of your feedback for Ajith — addressing both the “Continue Doing” and “Have More Impact” parts:


---

1) What should they continue doing?
Ajith consistently demonstrates strong technical expertise, especially in Alteryx, AA360, and PowerApps. His willingness to help others and collaborate across teams has been a great asset to project delivery. He should continue maintaining this supportive attitude, proactive problem-solving approach, and technical depth, which make him a dependable team member.

2) What could they do to have more impact?
To have an even greater impact, Ajith could focus on sharing his knowledge more broadly — through structured sessions, documentation, or mentoring teammates — to help upskill others. Additionally, taking more ownership in solution design and optimization discussions would allow him to contribute strategically and influence outcomes beyond execution.

Would you like me to make it sound more formal (for a performance review) or more conversational (for peer feedback or team appreciation)?
