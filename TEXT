1) Strengths and Achievements
This year, I successfully delivered three projects to production (ROB-102197: CUSIP Lookup, ROB-103027: ACAT End-to-End, and ROB-104122) and completed development for two others (ROB-105721: IRD1 Exceptions and ROB-105589: Fixed Rate Contract) which are ready for production. I also rebuilt the entire CMRC workflow from Access to Alteryx, adapting to new client requirements. As part of the Big Rock initiative, I identified a working solution for the Alteryx email setup and created an alternative using Python scripts. Additionally, I participated in a hackathon to present new automation ideas, collaborated with teammates to solve ACE portal issues, and organized team engagement sessions, contributing to innovation, efficiency, and collaboration within the team.
2) Development Areas
I aim to improve the efficiency of documentation and standardization processes, especially around SDD preparation, and enhance my communication with stakeholders to reduce rework caused by changing requirements. Additionally, I plan to strengthen my skills in Python and advanced Alteryx functions to develop more complex and scalable automation solutions that can further improve team productivity and delivery speed.
3) UBS Behaviours
Throughout the year, I demonstrated collaboration by helping teammates with ACE portal issues, innovation by developing new Alteryx email solutions, and accountability by ensuring delivery of challenging projects like ACAT End-to-End despite frequent requirement changes. Moving forward, I aim to enhance cross-team collaboration, proactively communicate with stakeholders to anticipate needs early, and explore more integrated automation opportunities using Alteryx, Python, and AA360 to align with UBS’s collaborative and innovative culture.
