Subject: Root Cause and Resolution for Skipped ACAT Account (HJ18479)

Hello Neil,

Root Cause:
The issue occurred when account HJ18479 was processed by the bot. As per the standard process, the bot identified the account and checked the RISK Reflection terminal to retrieve the associated Guaranteed accounts. The bot is configured to recognize Guaranteed accounts with specific prefixes such as 5V, 5F, 6M, or G9. However, in this instance, the terminal incorrectly displayed the same ACAT account (HJ18479) as its own Guaranteed account, prefixed with HJ—a prefix not included in the bot’s predefined list. As a result, the bot did not recognize it as a valid Guaranteed account and subsequently skipped processing this entry, moving on to the next.

Solution:
To prevent recurrence of this issue, I have updated the bot’s logic to include all Guaranteed accounts, regardless of prefix. Additionally, any Guaranteed account not matching the expected prefixes will now be marked as "Manual Review" in the Excel output, allowing for further verification. This ensures such anomalies are captured and flagged appropriately for review going forward.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
